This work basically centers around C Programming (Functions, nested loops)
wherein we work on the following;

Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
The program should return 0

Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet_'x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise

Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

Prototype: int print'_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero
